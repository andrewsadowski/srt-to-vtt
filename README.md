### Overview

This Electron app converts as many SRTs into VTTs as you need. It creates a VTT_Output directory in the folder of the provided SRTs with all your converted files.

### Prerequisites

- Download the release for your platform by navigating to the Releases tab, or clicking the badge for your platform above (Windows coming soon!)

### Running Application

Open the application, drag the srt you want processed into the window. The VTT files will be in the same directory as your provided SRT files, in a VTT_Output folder. The files will be named identically to their SRT counterparts.
